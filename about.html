<h1>Who Am I?</h1>
<p>I am a Junior at the University of Montana majoring in Computer Science. 
  I aspire to work with data to tell stories and form predictions. 
  I've had the opportunity to volunteer for my community, explore different cultures, and sharpen
  my skills as a Computer Scientist and as a human.</p>
